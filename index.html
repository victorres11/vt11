<p style="padding: 2.5em 2.5em 0em 2.5em">The majority of my career has been working as a Software engineer and Technical Project Manager in tech startups in San Francisco and New York, but I’ve also worked in various roles other roles across multiple business units. I’m interested in pivoting from the traditional Tech companies I’ve been involved with for my entire career to applying my skillsets to help a sports or high performance focused organization.</p>
<p style="padding: 2.5em 2.5em 0em 2.5em">Most of the projects I have experience in deal with data management, business intelligence, automation, building internal tooling, and scaling inefficient processes. Although I come from a technical background, I’ve found my strength is in understanding overall business goals and being able to apply technical and non-technical solutions when appropriate.</p>
<p style="padding: 2.5em 2.5em 0em 2.5em">My hope is that I could find an opportunity to contribute to a project somewhere in the intersection of tech and sports. From the research I’ve done I believe modern and high-end sports teams are starting to orient themselves to internal programs that have technical requirements within the world of performance analytics, sports medicine, strength & conditioning programs, opponent research, and recruiting.</p>
